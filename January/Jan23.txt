Input
- Vector, Scalar, Number, etc.
- Noted with "x" or "X" (use "W")

Output
- Noted with "ŷ" or "Ŷ" (use "Ŷ")

Target
- Noted with "y" or "Y" (use "Y")

Between Input and Output
- Weights ("w" or "W") (use "w")
- Bias ("b")

f(x) = 2x+5
- Think as a neural network:
    - Weight: 2
    - Input: X
    - Bias: 5
    - Target: f(x)
- To find how close the numbers are, use mean squared error (MSE)
    - (Ŷ - Y)^2
    - Also known as the loss
    - Ŷ - Y is called the residual (r)
    - To find loss with residual: 
        - Square the residual
        - Add the components
        - Divide by the number of components
    - loss = SSE / n
        - SSE (Sum Squared Error) = r^t * r
            - transposed residual * residual
